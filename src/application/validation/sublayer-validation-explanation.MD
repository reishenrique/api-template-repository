# Sublayer Validation

### Explanation
- The validation layer in Clean Architecture is responsible for ensuring that the input data received by the application is correct and compliant with business rules before being processed by the inner layers. This layer helps maintain the integrity and consistency of the data throughout the system.

### Role of the Validation Layer

1. Data Sanitization: Clean and normalizes input data to remove unwanted or dangerous characters, preventing vulnerabilities such as code injection.
2. Business Rule Verification: Ensures that received data complies with defined business rules, such as email format, numerical values limits, presence of required fields, etc.
3. Isolation of Responsibilities: Keeps validation responsabilities separate from other layers promoting Separation of Concerns.
4. Error Prevention: Prevents invalid data from reaching business logic or data access layers, preventing errors and incosistencies in processing.

Below, example of sign up user data validation using zod library for understanding.

```typescript
import { z } from 'zod';

export const signUpValidation = z.object({
    userName: z.string().min(8).max(16),
    email: z.string().email(),
    password: z.string().min(8).max(16)
})
```

- Benefits

1. Data Quality: Ensures that noly valid data is processed.
2. Security: Reduces security risks by filtering malicious inputs
3. Maintainability: Facilitates maintenance and evolution of the application by keeping validation rules centralized and separate.

Therefore, the validation layer is essential for ensuring the quality and integrity of the data flowing through an application, promoting a more robust and secure architecture.
